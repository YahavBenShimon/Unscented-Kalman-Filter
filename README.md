# Unscented Kalman Filter for 5-Variable State Parameter Tracking (Python and Matlab)

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) designed to track an object with 5 state parameters. 
The UKF is utilized due to its superior performance in handling non-linear measurement and transition models compared to the Extended Kalman Filter,
offering a more accurate and reliable solution for tracking applications with intricate dynamics.

### State Parameters
1. Parameter 1: x [m]
2. Parameter 2: z [m]
3. Parameter 3: v_x [m/s]
4. Parameter 4: v_z [m/s]
5. Parameter 5: theta [rad]

## Features
- Precise tracking of objects modeled non-linearly.
- Effective management of sensor noise and process uncertainties.
- Capability for real-time processing.
- In-depth documentation and illustrative examples.
